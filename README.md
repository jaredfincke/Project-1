What 

Data
I pulled my data from Kaggle's ppp-loan-data-paycheck-protection-program. The original file was over 100 MB large and unable to be pushed up to my git hub. Instead, the data folder in my github file has the clean data and a text file with a link to the original data source.  •	https://www.kaggle.com/susuwatari/ppp-loan-data-paycheck-protection-program
