# What leads to a Winning Baseball Team #


## Overview ##
Baseball is a multi-faceted game with pitching, hitting, baserunning, and fielding. General Managers, Scouts, and Fans use statistics to gauge all facets of a team’s performance. This project attempts focuses on a few key statistics, and attempts to reveal if one can accurately predict the number of wins a team obtains through them.  This project is specifically focused on fielding and its value. We will attempt to analyze the number of errors, that is when a player misplays a ball resulting in a benefit to the opposing team, and its relation to winning. 

## Goals ##
This project is specifically focused on fielding and its value. We will attempt to analyze the number of errors, that is when a player misplays a ball resulting in a benefit to the opposing team, and its relation to winning. Additionally, this project will combine other statistics from Hitting, Pitching, and Baserunning to see if one can accurately predict a winning baseball team. 

## Motivation & Background ##
There is a saying in sports that “Defense wins Championships”. Currently, the Major League Baseball Playoffs are in full-swing and SportsCenter routinely shows great catches and throws in their nightly “Top 10” plays. I want to know that even though great fielding makes for great highlights, is it really that important for winning baseball? Can we predict wins just by looking at fielding statistics, and can we predict wins by looking at fielding statistics plus other statistics from the other dimensions of the game?

## Data ##
I pulled my data from [Kaggle's Baseball Databank](https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/baseball-databank). This Project soley used the Teams CSV file.
